## Overview

REACT addresses the problem of **longitudinal active feature acquisition (LAFA)** — deciding *which* features to measure and *when*, across multiple time points, given that acquiring features has a cost. Rather than observing all features at every visit, REACT learns a policy (actor) that selects the most informative subset of features at each timestep to support downstream classification, while minimizing acquisition cost.

The key technical contribution is a **Gumbel-Sigmoid relaxation** that makes the discrete feature-selection problem differentiable, enabling end-to-end training of the acquisition policy. The pipeline consists of:

1. **Classifier pre-training** — a masked classifier trained to predict outcomes from arbitrary subsets of observed features.
2. **Oracle rollout generation** — a search procedure that produces near-optimal acquisition trajectories to supervise the actor.
3. **Actor training** — an iterative policy learner (with optional joint fine-tuning of the classifier) that uses Gumbel-Sigmoid gates to select features at each timestep.
4. **Evaluation** — assessment of acquisition quality, classification performance, and feature cost.

## Data Preparation

The codebase supports several datasets. Place your data in a subfolder matching the dataset name under the project root:

| Dataset key | Expected folder | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `womac` / `klg` | `./oai_data/` | OAI (Osteoarthritis Initiative) data |
| `adni` | `./adni/` | ADNI longitudinal biomarker data |

Each folder should contain `train`, `val`, and `test` splits in the format expected by `dataset.py`. The default dataset is `womac` (set in `config.py`).

---

## Quick Start

### Option A: Run the full pipeline with `main.py`

`main.py` orchestrates all four stages in sequence.

```bash
# Run everything with default settings (dataset = womac)
python main.py

# Specify a dataset
python main.py --data klg

# Override cost weights
python main.py --data womac --cw 0.05 --acw 0.001

# Use joint actor training (with classifier fine-tuning, joint is used for all REACT results in the paper)
python main.py --data womac --joint

# Skip stages you've already completed
python main.py --data womac --skip classifier oracle
```

**Pipeline arguments:**

| Argument | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `--data` | Dataset: `synthetic`, `cheears_demog`, `klg`, `womac`, etc. | Config default (`womac`) |
| `--cw` | Cost weight — controls the acquisition cost penalty | Config default |
| `--acw` | Auxiliary cost weight — penalty for static/demographic feature cost | Config default |
| `--joint` | Use joint iterative actor (fine-tunes classifier during actor training) | `False` |
| `--skip` | Space-separated list of steps to skip: `classifier oracle actor evaluate` | None |

---

### Option B: Run individual stages

Each stage can also be run as a standalone script.

#### Stage 1 — Train the masked classifier
```bash
python train_classifier.py
```

#### Stage 2 — Generate oracle rollouts
```bash
python generate_oracle.py
# Or with custom cost weight:
python generate_oracle.py --cost_weight 0.05
```

#### Stage 3 — Train the actor
```bash
# Standard iterative actor
python train_actor_iterative_joint.py --cost_weight 0.05 --aux_cost_weight 0.001

# Joint actor (fine-tunes classifier simultaneously)
python train_actor_iterative_joint.py --cost_weight 0.05 --aux_cost_weight 0.001
```

#### Stage 4 — Evaluate
```bash
python evaluate.py --cost_weight 0.05 --aux_cost_weight 0.001

# Evaluate the joint model
python evaluate.py --cost_weight 0.05 --aux_cost_weight 0.001 --joint

# Evaluate vanilla baseline (no acquisition)
python evaluate_vanilla.py
```

---

## Configuration

All hyperparameters live in `config.py`. The most commonly tuned settings:

```python
# Select dataset (can also be set via environment variable)
DATASET = 'womac'   # or 'klg', 'cheears_demog', 'synthetic', 'adni', ...

# Mask type for classifier pre-training
MASK_TYPE = 'uniform'  # 'uniform' or 'bernoulli'
```

**Key hyperparameters in `ACTOR_CONFIG`:**

| Key | Description |
|---|---|
| `cost_weight` | Weight on longitudinal feature acquisition cost in the actor loss |
| `aux_cost_weight` | Weight on static/auxiliary feature acquisition cost |
| `gate_tau` | Gumbel-Sigmoid temperature (lower = more discrete) |
| `threshold` | Decision threshold for converting soft gates to hard selections at inference |
| `planner_hidden` | Hidden layer sizes of the acquisition planner MLP |
| `time_emb_dim` | Dimension of temporal embedding |
| `patience` | Early stopping patience (epochs) |

**Feature costs** can be edited directly in `config.py` under `LONGITUDINAL_FEATURE_COSTS` and `STATIC_FEATURE_COSTS` to reflect real-world measurement costs for your application.

You can also override the dataset at runtime without editing `config.py`:
```bash
ACTOR_DATASET=klg python main.py
```

## Outputs

Results are saved to `./outputs/<dataset>/`:

| `oracle_rollout_cw<cw>.npz` | Oracle trajectories for the given cost weight |
| `actor_iterative_cw<cw>_acw<acw>.ckpt` | Trained actor checkpoint |
